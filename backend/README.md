# backend
A backend api for our project
We used python as our main language for the backend of MoneyBuddy
The system also uses FastAPI, Railway, Passlib, SQLalchemy, PostgreSQL and JWT
Sqlalchemy was used to connect to a postgresql user info database running on railway.app.
FastAPI is used to run the backend web server, which communicates with the frontend.
PassLib is used for encrypting/decrypting user passwords in the SQL database and pyjwt is used for decrypting JS user tokens for secure login.
